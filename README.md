# Travel-Landing-Page

This is from a code along video with Brad Traversy on Youtube.

Main reason for attempting this, was to learn how to implement a video as part of a showcase.

I'm also busy sharperning my skills with menu's especially when it comes to JS integrated ones.

This landing page is by far one of the best looking ones I have made, practive makes perfect!
